# ProjectEuler

Working on Project Euler problems. <br>
each file contains the solution for the problem listed.

My original solutions were all in Python.  In 2021 I started to port my earlier solutions to Julia to learn the language and ecosystem.  For the most part, the syntax is incredibly compatible.  I have not learned enough yet to perform any Julia specific optimizations.
