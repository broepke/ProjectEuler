# ProjectEuler

I am working on Project Euler problems.  
Each file contains the solution for the problem listed.

## Python
I started working through these problems with my then language of choice, which was Python.  For the most part, you don't need packages from the ecosystem to solve these problems, but I did use a few in cases where there was an advantage.  Mostly Numpy for matrix manipulation.

## Julia
In early 2021 I started to port the Python solutions to Julia to learn the syntax, language, and environments.  It proved to be a beneficial activity.  Julia is very promising.  For the computations so far with my problems, I didn't see a significant performance advantage over Python, but I'm interested in continuous learning.

## R
For a class on Text Analysis, I also started to program in R.  I find this ecosystem fascinating.  It's so mature it was enjoyable to perform analysis.  Just for fun, like Julia, I started to port all of the Python solutions into R. Similar to Python, not too many libraries were used. Still, in R's case, I chose to default to use them when they're available since it represents the workflow with R.  Lots of packages.
